  ## Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. This command-line application allows for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This allows a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

  ## Installation
  1. Clone the repository 2. run ```npm install``` in terminal
  
  ## Usage
  1. run ```node index.js``` in terminal. 2. Respond to the questions your are prompted with. 3. If you get a "Success!" message at the end, a README-output.md file get generated in the same directory as you run index.js
